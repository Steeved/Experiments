#Combinatorics Calculator

A [Calculator](calcVarCom.py) for three functions of combinatorics:
1. Factorial(N) - The number of ways to arrange N elements(N > 0)
2. Variation(N, K) - The number of ways to pick K elements of N(K <= N, N > 0)
3. Combination(N, K) - The number of ways to combine K elements of N(K <= N, N > 0)

> Usage:
> To evaluate an expression of one or more functions enter either "fact(N)"(for factorial), "var(N, K)"(for variation)
> or "com(N, K)"(for combination) and replace N and K with the numbers that you want to calculate the functions with.
